# KlickBrick CLI

This project is an exercise to get new persons onboarded in an easy way.
It includes the creation of a (manual) checklist, but also the installation
and configuration of tools needed by the new developer. Another things that
is possible, is to have the program generate an email intended for the IT
department.
