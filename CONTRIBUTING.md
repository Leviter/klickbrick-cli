## Installation

Ensure that you have the latest version of pip installed:

```
git clone git@github.com:leviter/klickbrick-cli.git

## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcomed! We'd like to review the design and implementation as early as
possible so please submit the pull request even if it's not 100%.
Let us know the purpose of the change and list the remaining items which need to be
addressed before merging. Finally, PR's should include unit tests and documentation
where appropriate.

## Code of conduct

Everyone is invited to participate in this project and discussions: we want to create a welcoming and friendly 
environment. Harassment of participants or other unethical and unprofessional behavior will not be tolerated in 
our organisation.
